# Project Report: P2_GuillemGauchia_240215
Changes Made to the Original Project:
1. Hay Machine Speed Increase:
Implemented a gradual increase in the speed of the Hay Machine over time until reaching a specified limit. The speed now increases periodically until it reaches a maximum value.
2. Sheep's Random Speed Range:
Modified the behavior of the sheep so that their speed is set randomly within a range. Each sheep now has a different speed, adding variability to their movements.
3. Reduced Shooting Interval:
Adjusted the shoot interval of the Hay Machine to decrease over time until reaching a specified limit. The time between shots now decreases gradually, making the gameplay more challenging as the game progresses.
